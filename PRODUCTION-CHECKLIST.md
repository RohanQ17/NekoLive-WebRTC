## üîß Deployment Steps

### Option 1: AWS EC2 Deployment

1. **Prepare AWS Environment**
   ```bash
   # Run the AWS preparation script
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy-aws.ps1
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Deploy using CloudFormation
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name nekolive-stack \
     --template-body file://cloudformation-template.json \
     --region us-east-1
   ```

3. **Configure Application**
   ```bash
   # SSH into EC2 instance
   ssh -i nekolive-key.pem ec2-user@<INSTANCE_IP>
   
   # Run production setup
   chmod +x deploy-production.sh
   ./deploy-production.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

1. **Build Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t nekolive .
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   # Update docker-compose.yml with your domain
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Configure SSL**
   ```bash
   # Copy SSL certificates to ./ssl/
   # Update nginx.conf with correct paths
   docker-compose restart nginx
   ```

### Option 3: Traditional Server

1. **Run Deployment Script**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy-production.sh
   sudo ./deploy-production.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Update with production values
   ```

3. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   pm2 start signaling-server.js --name "nekolive"
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   ```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200: `curl https://your-domain.com/health`
- [ ] WebSocket connections work properly
- [ ] Static files load correctly
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid and properly configured

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Two users can connect from different devices/networks
- [ ] Video and audio streams work bidirectionally
- [ ] Chat messages are delivered in real-time
- [ ] Media controls (mute/video toggle) function properly
- [ ] Room joining and leaving works correctly

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishes < 1 second
- [ ] Video call establishes < 5 seconds
- [ ] Server handles expected concurrent users
- [ ] Memory usage stays within limits

### Security Tests
- [ ] Rate limiting blocks excessive requests
- [ ] CORS policy blocks unauthorized origins
- [ ] SSL configuration scores A+ on SSL Labs
- [ ] No sensitive information exposed in headers
- [ ] Input validation prevents malicious payloads

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### Application Metrics
```bash
# Check application status
curl https://your-domain.com/stats

# Monitor PM2 processes
pm2 monit

# Check system resources
htop
df -h
free -m
```

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Application logs
pm2 logs nikolive

# Nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

# System logs
sudo journalctl -u nginx -f
```

### Automated Monitoring
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms configured (if using AWS)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring service configured (Pingdom, StatusCake, etc.)
- [ ] Error rate alerts setup
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts setup

## üîß Maintenance Tasks

### Daily Tasks
- [ ] Check application health and logs
- [ ] Monitor system resources
- [ ] Verify backup completion

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check for security updates
- [ ] Analyze user patterns and usage

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Review and rotate logs
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Security audit

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
```bash
# Check logs
pm2 logs nikolive
journalctl -u pm2-nodejs

# Check environment
echo $NODE_ENV
cat .env
```

**WebSocket connections fail:**
```bash
# Check nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status
```

**SSL certificate issues:**
```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in /path/to/cert.pem -text -noout

# Renew Let's Encrypt certificate
sudo certbot renew
```

**High memory usage:**
```bash
# Restart application
pm2 restart nikolive

# Check for memory leaks
pm2 monit
```

### Emergency Procedures

**Complete system failure:**
1. Check backup system status
2. Restore from latest backup
3. Verify all services are running
4. Test functionality end-to-end
5. Notify users of any downtime

**Security breach:**
1. Immediately block suspicious IPs
2. Change all passwords and API keys
3. Review logs for compromise scope
4. Update security measures
5. Notify users if necessary

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Use Application Load Balancer
- Configure Redis for session sharing
- Implement sticky sessions if needed
- Use multiple availability zones

### Vertical Scaling
- Monitor CPU and memory usage
- Upgrade instance size when needed
- Optimize application performance
- Use CPU-optimized instances for high load

### Cost Optimization
- Use Reserved Instances for stable workloads
- Implement auto-scaling for variable loads
- Monitor and optimize resource usage
- Use Spot Instances for development
